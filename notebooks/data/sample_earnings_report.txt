BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

Cloud Services Division
Revenue grew 32% to $1.2 billion, representing 50% of total revenue. Customer acquisition accelerated with 450 new enterprise contracts signed during the quarter. The division's operating margin improved to 28% from 24% in the prior year.

Enterprise Software Division
Revenue increased 8% to $900 million. License renewals remained strong at 94% retention rate. The division launched two new product modules in February, with early adoption exceeding expectations.

Consumer Products Division
Revenue declined 5% to $300 million, primarily due to supply chain disruptions affecting our retail channel. Management expects this segment to recover in Q2 as inventory levels normalize.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Product Development
We completed the beta testing phase for our AI-powered analytics platform, which is scheduled for general availability in Q2 2025. Early customer feedback has been highly positive, with 85% of beta users indicating strong purchase intent.

Market Expansion
Acme announced plans to enter three new international markets in Asia-Pacific during Q2. The company has established local partnerships and expects initial revenue contribution of $50-75 million in the second half of 2025.

M&A Activity
In March, we completed the acquisition of TechStart Inc., a specialized software company, for $450 million. The acquisition adds complementary technology and is expected to contribute $120 million in annualized revenue. Integration is proceeding ahead of schedule.

OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE

For Q2 2025, Acme expects:
- Revenue: $2.5 - $2.6 billion
- Operating margin: 17-18%
- Earnings per share: $1.90 - $2.05

For full year 2025, management reaffirms guidance:
- Revenue: $10.0 - $10.5 billion
- Operating margin: 18-19%
- Earnings per share: $7.75 - $8.25

The guidance assumes continued strong demand in cloud services, successful launch of the AI analytics platform, and stabilization of the consumer products division. The outlook does not include potential impact from pending regulatory changes in the European Union, which could affect 5-8% of our revenue base if implemented as currently proposed.

RISK FACTORS

The company faces several risks that could impact future performance:
- Intensifying competition in cloud services, particularly from larger technology companies
- Potential supply chain disruptions affecting hardware components
- Regulatory uncertainty in key international markets
- Dependence on key customer relationships, with our top 10 customers representing 35% of revenue

CONFERENCE CALL

Acme will host a conference call at 5:00 PM ET today to discuss these results. The call will be webcast on the company's investor relations website.
