AI has fundamentally changed that model. Modern AI systems operate continuously at runtime, depend on sensitive data and models, and introduce new regulatory obligations around accountability, auditability and governance.\\n\\nAs a result, sovereignty today extends beyond where data lives to include:\\n\\n*   Who operates the platform and under which authority\\n*   Where AI models run and how inference is governed\\n*   Who has administrative access and how it is enforced\\n*   How compliance can be demonstrated continuously, not just documented\\n\\nA fundamental architectural shift is required: one where sovereignty is an inherent property of the platform itself, not a contractual promise or deployment variant. It must deliver:\\n\\n1.   **Customer-operated control planes:**Organizations maintain direct operational authority over platform management, deployment decisions and system configurations without vendor intermediation.\\n2.   **In-boundary identity and keys:**All authentication, authorization, encryption keys and access management remain within jurisdictional boundaries under customer control.\\n3.   **Local logs and telemetry:**Comprehensive operational data, system telemetry and audit trails are generated, stored, and managed entirely within the sovereign boundary.1\\n4.   **Governed AI inference:**AI model deployment, inference execution and agent operations occur under local governance with full traceability and oversight.\\n\\nIntroducing IBM Sovereign Core:A fundamentally different approach\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/introducing-ibm-sovereign-core-a-new-software-foundation-for-sovereignty)\\n\\nA fundamentally different approach to how sovereignty is implemented, managed and proven, we built IBM Sovereign Core focused on three foundational principles that shape the software end to end:\\n\\n### 1. Sovereignty is a platform capability and it must be provable\\n\\nWith IBM Sovereign Core, sovereignty is enforced architecturally, not contractually. Control does not rely on policy overlays or provider-managed control planes, but on automated always-on controls and user-owned control planes. Built on open and transparent technologies Red Hat OpenShift, with air-gapped software that operates like SaaS but is fully under the company and local authority. Identity, encryption keys, logs, telemetry and audit evidence remain entirely within the sovereign boundary. Ongoing compliance capabilities are embedded directly into the software, enabling organizations to produce regulator-ready proof on demand, without manual, audit-driven processes.\\n\\n### 2.AI sovereignty is a first-class system property\\n\\nWithin the sovereign boundary, organizations can deploy CPU- and GPU-based clusters, bring approved open or proprietary models, and govern access to models, tools and knowledge sources through controlled gateways. AI inference and agent-based applications run locally, without exporting data or telemetry to external providers. Just as importantly, IBM Sovereign Core enforces sovereignty at runtime, not only at configuration time. Identity, access, model usage and operational activity are continuously monitored and recorded, creating a clear audit trail for AI systems operating in high-impact and regulated domains.\\n\\n### 3. Sovereignty is operationalized for speed and scale\\n\\nIBM Sovereign Core delivers a customer-operated control plane that can be deployed rapidly and operated consistently at scale, allowing localized central teams to operate thousands of cores and hundreds of nodes with different sovereign requirements and controls from a single unique control plane. Automated configuration of identity, security, and compliance is built in from the outset, while self-service provisioning for CPU, GPU, VM and AI inference environments enables repeatable deployment across enterprise-run and partner-operated multi-tenant models, without sacrificing control.\\n\\nBuilt on open, enterprise-grade technologies such as Red Hat OpenShift, IBM Sovereign Core enables organizations to extend existing investments across infrastructure, platforms and operational tooling—whether on-premises, in-region cloud or partner-operated environments. Sovereignty is established without resetting the technology foundation or requiring greenfield rebuilds.\\n\\nThe architecture of IBM Sovereign Core\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n[](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/introducing-ibm-sovereign-core-a-new-software-foundation-for-sovereignty)\\n\\nSovereignty is an inherent property of the architecture itself, providing hardware and infrastructure flexibility:\\n\\n![Image 2: Figure 1: IBM Sovereign Core Architecture Overview](https://assets.ibm.com/is/image/ibm/image-1-final?ts=1768598279033&dpr=off) Figure 1: IBM Sovereign Core Architecture Overview \\n\\nThrough IBM Sovereign Core's architecture, customers will experience:\\n\\n1.   **Portal**: Provides the Control Plane user experience.\\n2.   **Hardware Optionality**: Infrastructure abstraction and hardware flexibility using OpenShift and OpenShift Virtualization.\\n3.   **Operations and Orchestration**: Delivers automated coordination of platform workflows.\\n4.   **Compliance Center**: Provides governance, risk management and compliance capabilities for the platform.\\n5.   **Catalog**: A curated collection of atomic accelerators that enable application owners to deploy and operate traditional and AI applications.\\n\\n![Image 3: Figure 2: IBM Sovereign Core Architecture: Fully opinionated, detailed view.

A logical single pane of glass solution providing flexibility, consistency and security to host and manage traditional and AI applications \\n\\nWhat does this mean for organizations?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n[](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/introducing-ibm-sovereign-core-a-new-software-foundation-for-sovereignty)\\n\\nIBM Sovereign Core turns sovereignty into an operational capability. By embedding control, provability and AI governance directly into the software, it enables organizations to operate AI environments that balance technological advancement with demonstrable authority over their systems.\\n\\nThrough IBM Sovereign Core, organizations will experience real-world benefits:\\n\\n*   **Operate under sovereign authority**: Operational control is transferred to the organization or sovereign operator; not extended from outside the boundary.\\n*   **Demonstrate compliance and sovereignty through operation.**This enables organizations to demonstrate both sovereignty and compliance posture on demand, using operational evidence rather than relying on periodic audits, static attestations or manual reporting.\\n*   **Run AI entirely in-boundary, with governance at runtime.** AI sovereignty is enforced at runtime, governing where inference happens, who controls models, and how decisions are logged, traced and reviewed.\\n*   **Move with cloud-like agility, without losing control.** By reducing bespoke engineering and ongoing operational overhead, IBM Sovereign Core enables organizations to operate sovereign environments for sensitive or AI workloads.\\n*   **Preserve long-term independence.** Designed for replaceability and hybrid operation, IBM Sovereign Core establishes sovereignty as a foundation for long-term choice, portability and architectural independence—allowing organizations to continue leveraging existing infrastructure and platform investments while retaining full operational authority over sovereign environments.\\n*   **Deploy with flexibility:**Run the platform with direct operational authority, or work with trusted local service providers to operate the environment. IT service providers can use IBM Sovereign Core as a standardized foundation for delivering sovereign cloud and AI services at scale.\\n*   **Extend existing investments:**Leverage existing infrastructure, platforms and operational tooling across on-premises, in-region cloud or partner-operated environments.\\n\\nPutting sovereign operations to work\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n[](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/introducing-ibm-sovereign-core-a-new-software-foundation-for-sovereignty)\\n\\nStarting in February, IBM Sovereign Core will be available in tech preview, with full general availability planned for mid-year 2026.

[Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) to power its [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/) features, including a major [Siri](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/30/apple-intelligence-ai-siri-iphone.html) upgrade expected later this year.\\n\\nThe multiyear partnership will lean on Google\\'s [Gemini](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/google-adds-gemini-features-to-gmail-message-summaries-proofreading-.html) and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models, according to a joint statement obtained by CNBC\\'s Jim Cramer.\\n\\n\"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google\\'s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we\\'re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,\" Apple said in a[statement](https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/company-announcements/joint-statement-google-apple/) Monday.\\n\\nThe models will continue to run on Apple devices and the company\\'s private cloud compute, the companies added.\\n\\nApple declined to comment on the terms of the deal. Google referred CNBC to the joint statement.\\n\\nIn August, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/apple-explores-using-google-gemini-ai-to-power-revamped-siri?srnd=undefined) reported that Apple was in [early talks with Google](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/google-shares-rise-on-report-of-apple-using-gemini-for-siri.html) to use a custom Gemini model to power a new iteration of Siri. The news outlet later [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri) that Apple was planning to pay about $1 billion a year to utilize Google AI.\\n\\nThe deal is another major indicator of growing trust in Google\\'s [accelerating AI agenda](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/27/how-google-put-together-the-pieces-for-its-ai-comeback.html) and [comeback against](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/27/how-google-put-together-the-pieces-for-its-ai-comeback.html) OpenAI. In 2025, the search giant logged its [best year since 2009](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/31/google-stock-wraps-best-year-since-2009-as-ai-excites-wall-street-.html) and surpassed Apple in market capitalization last week for the [first time since 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/alphabets-market-cap-surpasses-apples-for-first-time-since-2019.html).\\n\\nGoogle already pays Apple billions each year to be the default search engine on iPhones. But that lucrative partnership briefly came into question after Google was found to hold an illegal internet[search monopoly](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/11/google-to-face-doj-in-the-first-major-tech-monopoly-trial-in-decades.html).\\n\\nIn [September](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html), a judge ruled against a worst-case scenario outcome that could have forced Google to divest its Chrome browser business.\\n\\nThe decision also allowed Google to continue to make deals such as the one with Apple.\\n\\nRead more CNBC tech news\\n------------------------\\n\\n*   [Nvidia set to supplant Apple as TSMC\\'s top customer, signaling chip industry\\'s \\'changing dynamic\\'](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/nvidia-set-to-supplant-apple-as-tsmcs-largest-customer.html)\\n*   [Nvidia and Alphabet VC arms back AI startup Synthesia at $4 billion valuation](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/nvidia-alphabet-vc-arms-back-synthesia.html)\\n*   [Meta\\'s Reality Labs cuts sparked fears of a \\'VR winter\\'](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/metas-reality-labs-cuts-sparked-fears-of-a-vr-winter.html)\\n*   [Musk\\'s $1 trillion pay package renews focus on soaring CEO compensation](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/musks-1-trillion-pay-package-renews-focus-on-rising-ceo-compensation.html)\\n\\nShares climbed following the news but later pulled back.

Last year, we introduced [agentic tools for shoppers](https://blog.google/products/shopping/agentic-checkout-holiday-ai-shopping/) and made agent-led payments seamless and secure with our [Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol). We believe in an agentic commerce future that is open, collaborative and built for everyone to succeed. Partnering with leading retailers and platforms, we\\'re sharing several announcements today that are an important step in that journey.\\n\\n### Unlock retail growth with a new open standard\\n\\nToday, we\\'re [launching](http://ucp.dev/) the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a new open standard for agentic commerce that works across the entire shopping journey — from discovery and buying to post-purchase support. UCP establishes a common language for agents and systems to operate together across consumer surfaces, businesses and payment providers. So instead of requiring unique connections for every individual agent, UCP enables all agents to interact easily. UCP is built to work across verticals and is compatible with existing industry protocols like Agent2Agent ([A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/)), Agent Payments Protocol ([AP2](https://ap2-protocol.org/)) and Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)).\\n\\nUCP was co-developed with industry leaders including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart, and endorsed by more than 20 others across the ecosystem like Adyen, American Express, Best Buy, Flipkart, Macy\\'s Inc., Mastercard, Stripe, The Home Depot, Visa and Zalando.\\n\\nSupport of the Universal Commerce Protocol from across the ecosystem.\\n\\n![Image 3: Universal Commerce Protocol graphic with 30 major company logos.](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/FOR_JAN_11_LAUNCH_UCP_Partner_Log.width-100.format-webp.webp)\\n\\nTo start, UCP will soon power a new checkout feature on eligible Google product listings in AI Mode in Search and the Gemini app, allowing shoppers to check out from eligible U.S. retailers right as they\\'re researching on Google. The feature is built with security at its core: shoppers can buy confidently with Google Pay using payment methods and shipping info already saved in Google Wallet and soon, will be able to make a purchase with PayPal. Retailers remain the seller of record, with the ability to customize the integration to their specific needs, all while helping to capture sales and avoid abandoned carts. In the coming months, we\\'ll work with retailers to expand globally and add more capabilities — like discovering related products, applying loyalty rewards, and powering custom shopping experiences on Google.\\n\\nBuy directly from eligible retailers on Google\\'s AI surfaces.\\n\\n### Connect with customers using a branded AI agent\\n\\nWe\\'re also launching [Business Agent](https://support.google.com/brandprofile/answer/16410382), a new way for shoppers to chat with brands, right on Search. It\\'s like a virtual sales associate that can answer product questions in a brand\\'s voice, enabling retailers to connect with consumers during critical shopping moments and help drive sales.\\n\\nBusiness Agent is live starting tomorrow with retailers like Lowe\\'s, Michael\\'s, Poshmark, Reebok and others. Eligible U.S. retailers can choose to activate and customize this branded agent in Merchant Center. In the coming months, they\\'ll be able to train the agent based on their data, access new customer insights, provide offers for related products and enable direct purchases — including agentic checkout — within the experience.\\n\\nShoppers can chat with eligible retailers directly on Search.\\n\\n### Optimize your presence in the conversational commerce era\\n\\nThe way people shop is changing, but our goal remains the same: to help retailers get discovered. That\\'s why we\\'re announcing dozens of new data attributes in Merchant Center designed for easy discovery in the conversational commerce era, on surfaces like AI Mode, Gemini and Business Agent. These new attributes complement retailers\\' existing data feeds and go beyond traditional keywords to include things like answers to common product questions, compatible accessories or substitutes. We will be rolling these out with a small group of retailers soon and expanding to more in the coming months.\\n\\n### Introducing Direct Offers\\n\\nAs shoppers turn to AI for discovery, retailers need smarter ways to deliver value. That\\'s why we\\'re continuing to test ads in AI Mode and we\\'re now introducing Direct Offers. This new Google Ads pilot allows advertisers to present exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to buy — like a special 20% off discount — directly in AI Mode.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works: Imagine you search \"I\\'m looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean.\" Google already elevates the most relevant products to meet your search criteria. But often, you are only ready to buy if you\\'re getting a great deal. Now relevant retailers have an opportunity to also feature a special discount. This helps you get better value and helps the retailer close the sale.\\n\\nUser flow of Direct Offers pilot in AI Mode, labeled \"Sponsored deal.\"\\n\\nWith Direct Offers, retailers set up relevant offers they want to feature in their campaign settings and Google will use AI to determine when an offer is relevant to display. We are initially focusing on discounts for the pilot and will expand to support the creation of offers with other attributes that help shoppers prioritize value over price alone, such as bundles and free shipping. We\\'re already collaborating with brands like Petco, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Samsonite, Rugs USA and Shopify merchants to shape Direct Offers into a faster, smarter way to help retailers connect with the next generation of shoppers.\\n\\nThis new era of shopping will be powered by AI. We look forward to building it together.\\n\\nPOSTED IN:\\n\\n*   [Google Ads](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/)\\n*   [Shopping](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/shopping/)\\n\\n### Related stories\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Demand_Gen_Drops_01.width-300.format-webp.webp) Google Ads #### See the newest product features in January\\'s Demand Gen Drop.

Given that this statement was made in January 2026, \"in the coming months\" strongly implies that global expansion will commence within the same year. Furthermore, the UCP has been co-developed and endorsed by over 20 global partners, including international companies such as Flipkart (India), Zalando (Europe), Adyen, Mastercard, Stripe, and Visa, indicating a design and intention for international reach from its inception.

Are we just making extra work for ourselves? Not according to CNET\\'s David Watsky, who sees this as the future of fridges.\\n\\nThat future has a lot of competition. Companies have tried to make smart fridges that know what\\'s inside, so you can see which foods are about to expire or generate recipes based on what you have on hand. Some think AI is the answer, with cameras that detect what you\\'ve loaded.[GE Profile\\'s new smart fridge](https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/grocery-barcode-scanner-is-the-best-new-fridge-feature-in-years/) is using the more tried-and-true barcode technology that\\'s easier and more familiar.\\n\\n![Image 8: a robot vacuum cleaning stairs](https://www.cnet.com/pictures/ces-2026-overall-products/)\\n\\n4 of 33 Ajay Kumar/CNET\\n\\nA robot vacuum that also does stairs\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nLast year, during CES, I chuckled at Roborock\\'s[Saros Z70](https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/a-robot-vacuum-that-picks-up-socks-stole-our-hearts-and-socks-at-ces-2025/)robotic vacuum and its robot arm that would grab things out of the way.

Now we\\'re talking.\\n\\nThe fact that it navigates stairs is cool, for sure, but what tipped me toward being a believer is that it also cleans the stairs as it goes, turning 90 degrees with one leg on the lower stair to keep its stability while vacuuming the stairs.\\n\\nHave you had to vacuum stairs?

It\\'s a freestanding humanoid robot that will soon be put to work in Hyundai factories, with an exceptional range of motion, durability and easy repairability. CNET\\'s Katie Collins got[up close and personal with Atlas](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-got-up-close-and-personal-with-boston-dynamics-new-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026/)to learn more about it.\\n\\n![Image 18: a person holding a knife and slicing tomatoes](https://www.cnet.com/pictures/ces-2026-overall-products/)\\n\\n9 of 33 Haley Henschel/Mashable\\n\\nA chef\\'s knife that cuts through food with ease\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nMost home kitchen knives aren\\'t that sharp, so cutting something delicate like a tomato sometimes gives way to a squishy mess.\\n\\nWhat if the knife could slice cleanly with very little effort? A high-quality, well-sharpened knife will do that, but not many home chefs sharpen to that level. Instead, Seattle Ultrasonics designed the[C-200, an ultrasonic chef\\'s knife](https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/what-its-like-to-slice-food-with-an-ultrasonic-knife/)that vibrates 30,000 times per second. This allows the blade to slide smoothly through food and prevents some slices from sticking to the sides of the blade. Ultrasonic knives are fairly common for larger, industrial uses, but the $399 C-200 is the first one developed for a home kitchen.\\n\\n![Image 20: A dartboard with a Millennium Falcon surround and a large light ring around it](https://www.cnet.com/pictures/ces-2026-overall-products/)\\n\\n10 of 33 James Bricknell/CNET\\n\\nBullseye more than womp rats with this Star Wars dartboard\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSomeone must\\'ve looked at the radiating design of a dartboard and said, \"hyperspace,\" because it certainly fits as the central element of a[Star Wars-themed frame](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/star-wars-smart-dartboard/)meant to look like the Millennium Falcon. Target Darts, which manufactures high-quality dartboards, showcased the $200 board and border, as well as a $650 Omni version that features a light ring around the board. The ring is studded with four cameras to track the darts\\' positions and keeps score in a connected app.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a Star Wars and darts fan, this set should bring balance to your game room and let you pretend to be Darth Vader.\\n\\n(Let\\'s be honest: I really wanted to write \"Darts Vader.\")\\n\\n![Image 22: Scott Stein from CNET wearing Razer Project Motoko headphones](https://www.cnet.com/pictures/ces-2026-overall-products/)\\n\\n11 of 33 Scott Stein/CNET\\n\\nHeadphones that act like smart glasses\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nCameras embedded in smart glasses are becoming more common, with the addition of AI tech making it possible to ask smart assistants things like, \"What am I looking at?\" But not everyone wants to wear glasses.

Multiple sources state that the testnet is designed to allow miners, developers, researchers, and users to participate in testing and validating the quantum-resistant solution before a mainnet migration or deployment. While the company has outlined broader plans and objectives for 2026 related to quantum secure systems and hardware commercialization, there is no specific mention or definitive timeline provided for the mainnet release of their quantum-safe Bitcoin fork before the end of 2026. The current status is clearly stated as a testnet, inviting community participation for testing and validation. Therefore, it is not clear whether the transition to mainnet will occur within the specified timeframe.', answer_sources='https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGJJV1AAFo0GD7-lvRjWIW1HM1fPWNrOeWtZwT7402-m_xh7vncBlYBGfoPzcnRdWvkch91POoeLZ2i4WbSl4xmnSrvhfMZLaU_iNmX4otHoPlXBENY2E-53k-M1222quWBGtvcmMJXN_aTCGrgF5-SVusROwfup7Yy3A7k1IM-UlJZ152-6JOIrM29i8hEtunz0NOuMIUwWiAN7AS4NrIPXSRTyttyEpsRcMqrLsBeOh6MNmzsZQ==, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEPFOTngO2AXirb00fb_nJYmUE8eT7OcaMfYFQHTQPROpVT68u-zQZEVRmW9wtK5Iw8k9-CUhKiBjBqpVD0GgOwgm1jD0fYkOcEiykUhcxJzk4H9kFeazvdsplc6u-Qi_hA1zI0zBlFTpthNWesdM5lA68TwRPBCiAbOTZmy87b10R_SUXWkl_1fQUUcN2bYliEm7ijMlqIEusfyjjWIdzvgO1EkvJn6Ls-YDhHnkMO5qAxuwN8wUZZjKGBBXIen4RrvrUiqObM8og8g6-7yPesr1pGgEJpx-AgZFF6TxHTVtzQtDDGpw4MbU57ORiucX8=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHha0CjuRpczRio2CKlz8P1FRVPQcHufnnX1PmeWr3YG0u9Ig7yo7Nh-uvnNHnDXuG4-_uNmsonFA8vAOU8m1RZxhDnCsQgoBBLv-g1HPSlNd5POLYhgSkxB3JfgStLb-1fd26r0Bj-bw2DKTgZRi8hzbIHJ52bcr2yI9fJmsWSVSLLgPdKci8gVCXZjm982m2wnWlbzR4JRb9wvUlYuHPzH9T2zliQsR2pcb6ucwsgwhv7lMvF_i2y5rW5LusBi4rzJkEM4ISRmcXTy56t3vEAHedp, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGt33oRk7dEg5H5_3Ji0wBQaFfkqqOE4StcQ5F81R2hjV7A7fXtU99gup6_WyNfTDxdNPOWeHJLDo16Vr4VZPjvL7aN_v3yjy95OOv-UluLt7z2ZSPK-ZnLxuOlw0nENmXOCUjlYXYHEu7NBn-Jqj5fW-uDNH1tADtHHCECaoosGsJQY9oBIVe_-wphNL3SDd_vlQvaEUAP3blo0K3vEkdmqAwzMbcGz85Ras0=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEaMME2DhqeBYUq7HK2gqfOph7G1Z1GR3I_GrXdw6PtWl1rVzUYMFH4PEqjQZ6pYlTs7qnywvyXi2FpxWQWm_uYNUjBLyoQjSX0su9M1it-0iEWnPrkB4tLfElFt0MH8eCx87AeRJEDL-UClbjG95qWkt17y1kNbYaRoie1CUp21yVKDp59EQi22WL6xyQ8rPcE047dKXt91sYapC4r-42g0W9uUjR1xsDRAIkqXem3AL35sJjf7J9uHbGL_02TiuOSmeMwHA==, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG-PrXOeUBm-oL2t_LNCnv6sO9VVtHhvVQYEoJTtupJVQLmCGB8edpylnV_BDjZwZJOTRcu4nQ6fSmL4hn--sjG5R3Pb-d_jGSAB67unO02BJcl3VrqXyMvKeU=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHfzAoMINa9lCiN5JUPKfEDF550ThYLyW1hwEcjTx3_9AI6M4FnXB4wO8BO3PIzrvFH1hcf8JQZCvnYWcjZjcTCAlcbDudrOJV8lfMOdwPrzU9KzRka7EJjSzN1TmOTFJwDjYTK6az568tyLcP1GIFzZuwEq15nL527ISU1aH_86DnQPsj20v_qCpT5mCHLCEyOdkruWh3MYEeQiCB2vNWNltHsb9rVTg-J3m8G7snhhBwTaESkTO9WX9cFjvbf7mDIJN5Xl-uDhXa-22IruFO0, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGznejE-a2rV6HT17ivbgj3ogyLZkNJzGSXKRuw_pvo3xmEWkhvHUSe1fGR_KV8HlyMSajyL9SO61vR2n3Uf2X3zjZzQPLt_pvGyliSBNnYpfC4kWAGie6pD36S7NnudX1kkNwuaMoG_PhkF_6PLDavFP27p07DNvi90C8vZo7Du99jPQuQhGZSPEokcXZF6ASeaGY1Ey5YoTfJB2zaXxyHnD6Q9ThC7fsrhqkhDQ==', additional_properties={}), prompt=None, context=None, rollouts=None, meta=SampleMeta(additional_properties={'sample_id': '177d0a64-fabb-45ff-a75a-d5bb644c8eef', 'filter_reason': 'Undetermined label', 'parent_sample_id': 'faf215a7-8fb7-47e7-8964-16784842542e', 'processing_time_ms': 9836.5}), is_valid=False, additional_properties={}),\n",

From gaming-focused specs to next-gen waveguides, the show floor and private suites were buzzing with announcements that signal a transformative year ahead for augmented reality (AR) and extended reality (XR).\\n\\n### **XREAL steals the spotlight with big partnerships and big ambitions**\\n\\nXREAL had arguably the most headline-grabbing announcements at CES:\\n\\n*   **Gaming gets serious**: XREAL unveiled its partnership with Asus ROG, introducing the first smart glasses with a 240 Hz display; a spec that gamers will appreciate for ultra-smooth visuals. This move positions further cements XREAL\\'s glasses as a gaming accessory and when paired with a PC, they can also function as a productivity tool.\\n\\n*   **Google partnership**: Beyond gaming, XREAL announced a multi-year collaboration with Google, marking the first major Android XR development news of 2026 and likely means that XREAL won\\'t stop working on Android XR after Project Aura.\\n\\n*   **Fuel for growt**h: To top it off, XREAL secured $100 million in new funding, signaling strong investor confidence and giving the company plenty of runway to innovate and scale.\\n\\n### **Viture\\'s \"Beast\" lives up to its name**\\n\\nIn a private suite, Viture showcased its latest device, aptly named The Beast,and it didn\\'t disappoint. The display quality was stunning, truly worthy of the moniker. But the real game-changer? 3 Degrees of Freedom (3 DoF) tracking, which puts Viture in direct competition with XREAL. Expect this feature to trickle down to other brands later in 2026, intensifying competition and benefiting consumers with more choice and better tech.\\n\\n### **Lumus pushes the boundaries of AR displays**\\n\\nMy best demo experience came from Lumus, the company behind the optics in Meta\\'s AR glasses. Lumus introduced new geometric waveguides offering a 70° field of view which is a massive leap forward. While these won\\'t hit consumer products this year, expect them in devices within the next two years.\\n\\nWhy does this matter? These waveguides are highly efficient, minimizing light loss and eliminating the dreaded eye glow problem. Combined with a lightweight form factor and high fidelity, this tech will enable AR glasses to transition from simple heads-up displays to fully immersive experiences.\\n\\n### **More brands are jumping in—thanks to a mature supply chain**\\n\\nOne of the most interesting trends at CES 2026 was the influx of new players entering the smart glasses space. Brands like Amazfit and XGIMI, traditionally known for wearables and projectors respectively, are now launching AR glasses. Why? The technology and supply chain have matured to the point where reference designs are readily available. This means companies can make minimal changes to existing designs and still deliver competitive products.\\n\\nThis evolution lowers the barrier to entry, accelerates innovation, and ensures consumers will have more options at different price points. It\\'s a sign that smart glasses are moving from early adopter tech to a broader consumer category.\\n\\n### **Beyond AI: Real use cases are emerging**\\n\\nWhile \"AI\" is the default answer to the question of smart glasses\\' purpose, CES showcased a broader range of practical applications:\\n\\n*   **Payments on the go**: Rokid demonstrated glasses capable of mobile payments, hinting at a future where wallets become obsolete.\\n\\n*   **Fitness integration:** Brands like Amazfit and Meta displayed workout stats in real time, turning glasses into personal trainers.\\n\\n*   **Health tracking**: Even Realities G2, announced before CES, now integrates health metrics via the R1 ring.\\n\\n*   **Smarter AI assistants**: AI isn\\'t just answering questions anymore, it\\'s actively listening and interjecting with relevant information when needed.\\n\\n### **What this means for 2026 and beyond**\\n\\nThe smart glasses category is heating up. XREAL\\'s partnerships and funding show confidence in the long-term vision, while competitors like Viture and RayNeo are upping the ante with immersive features. Meanwhile, Lumus is laying the groundwork for the next generation of AR optics that will redefine what \"immersive\" truly means. And with new brands entering the space thanks to mature supply chains, expect rapid growth and diversification.\\n\\nThe big question now: Will consumers embrace these devices beyond gaming and fitness? With AI becoming proactive and new use cases emerging, the answer might be yes sooner than we think.\\n\\n**Bottom line**: CES 2026 wasn\\'t just about flashy prototypes rather it was a clear signal that smart glasses are moving toward mass adoption. With major players investing heavily and technology advancing rapidly, the next two years will be pivotal for AR and XR.\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.idc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jitesh_Ubrani_L.png?w=160)\\n\\nJitesh Ubrani -  Research Manager  -  IDC\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n[Analyst Profile](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF003967)\\n\\n Jitesh is a Research Manager for the Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, including Wearables, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Tablets, and Phones.

This technology was explicitly designed for \"the next phase of consumer AR\" and \"to maximize immersion without compromising comfort or wearability.\" Lumus also stated that the ZOE waveguide is \"Manufactured with standard optical glass and integrated into Lumus\\' established mass-production processes,\" indicating readiness for scaled production. Furthermore, Lumus CEO Ari Grobman stated that with ZOE, they are \"introducing the next evolution of optical engines that will underpin the coming generation of AR glasses.\" Industry reports from CES 2026 echoed this sentiment, noting that Lumus\\'s advancements \"seem poised to seriously elevate the optical quality of the next wave of high-end smartglasses.\" Lumus previously supplied waveguides for the Meta Ray-Ban Display AR glasses in 2025, demonstrating their capability for mass-produced consumer products. While no specific consumer smart glasses product featuring Lumus\\'s 70° FOV waveguides has been announced with a definitive release date by the end of 2028, the statements from Lumus and industry analysts strongly indicate that this technology is prepared and intended for integration into consumer AR glasses within the \"coming generation,\" which reasonably extends to the end of 2028. The development, manufacturing readiness, and stated purpose of the ZOE waveguide for consumer immersion make it highly probable that such products will be released by the specified timeframe.', answer_sources='https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGlFjickxPWT1lJHIJboeCutHH1IXBWoepaLOZ8aOy64Yq2Fifaa-WMLMDizmqK_XUFfrPmsHK6wXL_o1JIo1eBYaVyZdb_sXsIZL2itItKtsdRMyO1gvxvqbfGq6udCZ9seMc7Wxpwis1M8__nM80xlMBRKQ4pL7HFxwKGI6ak91WJNForLT4cQUgNQjh3fb25ldoBU95jhoTlBobExF_Kigvf1zNm--HBRUyXrA2bpRTxHRHJqySZduN6_Fb-WU7bxbbC6qT4IgqcoawXrdyr_D_7Wg1slhPaER_EFb7uD8hnYuD2-I0SRtmBRI4j4eZrZpo=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH-ykduPHSWDejhNUpF0RkwqaP87K7NN6tymXfZsX83BGDEdOowgqBLbDTNwHZtcsomkol62PY75UDTK8UO17pwbXsW85MZMXZQSTwOQL-UrI0cjHFGG8t8RlUVOTdcQLJRNlb10I8TrOunI3UaBR22SLpvTxDuGeMUI__b3Zx3PG99BgwvXX8CpU7a1krHydn_pf6EHWb-KnXXb_j63WcQalhSGW88BVPHNjC7', additional_properties={}), prompt=None, context=None, rollouts=None, meta=SampleMeta(additional_properties={'sample_id': '3cdadb4e-0579-4d57-a505-69913d3f7e46', 'parent_sample_id': 'c8bac722-081f-4ccc-9dd0-ce0fc7d95893', 'processing_time_ms': 22657.968}), is_valid=True, additional_properties={}),\n",

For instance, they reported a net loss of $0.11 per share for Q2 FY2026 and a net loss of $10.6 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. The company\\'s fiscal year ends on March 31, meaning the \"next fiscal year\" (FY2027) would conclude on March 31, 2027. The Sentinel project is a government-funded proof of concept involving GSI Technology\\'s Gemini-II APU for an autonomous perimeter security system, with approximately $1 million in government funding for software optimization and integration. While this project is a strategic development and has generated investor interest, it is explicitly described as a \"proof of concept.\" GSI Technology\\'s CEO has indicated plans to initiate pilot shipments in calendar year 2026, with potential for substantial revenue gains in the latter half of that year, which falls largely within FY2207. However, current analyst sentiment includes a \"sell\" rating, and the company continues to operate at a loss with negative margins. Financial analysis suggests that for a loss-making business like GSI Technology, a high Price-to-Sales ratio reflects investor focus on potential future demand rather than current profitability, and the company\\'s financial story could change quickly if government-backed projects do not convert to meaningful revenue. There is no definitive information or forward-looking guidance from GSI Technology or financial analysts that explicitly states the Sentinel project will lead to a positive annual net income by the end of the next fiscal year (March 31, 2027). While the project could contribute to future revenue, offsetting the company\\'s historical and projected overall net losses to achieve annual net profitability is not explicitly indicated as a likely outcome within the specified timeframe. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine if the project will lead to positive annual net income by the end of the next fiscal year.', answer_sources='https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGdt_mJGW-oZz2ay4sNdF1rNFwyozsKAhFZRpy-cU0nQhuQMHj8aAUy8aYodd7N8BwH6dal_UAZWEvF2FHDTtDhDgHqZT09-TN_5qDGjsAIKRUThAvqlim7AcRHCHMcStYTyMyMwxGBtTTIojftfFyRNGD2f4I=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEsy7NADI7G_RmDvfGRFeO1mgKyV1EdUNEmjdAyUM-TuLO2_iPYqNrSwU7Vu4M5t16fGGcFj-B-w9Wka2OwQgbE5k7ea0L6WthdoJG20HXss1IMR2IK18d_glxPR0qrc3JchXJeXDEzd6QSO0Ac2e--yYR2LXNHLdcC, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQECwyxCVUa0WCbgFW0yQKfH82pSKfUi-hwRmbwFmrGRTjVYxA-LydITwVPjSasf6d2pwVzD3rvAL_SdeYfP4K-0XBLWlKnaQj7PT50SfKUk35FzxJl3Fj04v9f8aQdXh958JI_MZQbdEyOmGyYyun_P83z6m-Bsb8wsare_rTO_jo2hzJ9RtUjZofS3XTKxMHi-7Niz8MK0zltkGcFotbv416SShG58OaVUZ2WDIuaPQGLi4nQgT0ELS_yqaklpOcduvTO5cMnqdkb3Cqy5yZ9bKd6bLzCrDdzCc7S-7Ak=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgWwZCIxvuvDR6yCQ8Fa0l3aULSglWRajLMrmvaEDoT7K7IDodQhS1EdqakNcjcseed41NwvZPLoLF3snbbTv3N-c76487pum361vjz61DSjnHtCZsub-1xeGZBYH5ze2meOe5MG87Slm15iQEMqRTHqT4-rMyaZw2lnVcG0sXVus77vKcY2yymL6XBYbF0FI2KYFn9FBw9vJIO4rF8LaWjtJ8R4_9DcOvfNR83lMvVJ8ZbOui5-TM4vZZ9ohDfbAPc8IU9JLQ, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE69JheysvtL8qkCCORV8ScJCxgusJfFZxPp5twHJhZOd3hbLs8TYdCm8s5Lx_kmXmg6R1AH5cqEjnYcJFK1w5p6apffjaNZyDl78rV2DxTYIUJzvFEhFM2ArZl2LrOoSL9rExisr1f4S8gWQpawDE-dXegfDjn708LYZYMNEvMOOGlWfYjwoqjk7P49TKZGF8oTVy7iqhfP7AWWyYTp74JufIwaUyNucvaj3L0WmEFGXcCxPUgOU_U57vOp7gI2QjjSzr2c0TixWetdGgynvN2hd-elRAjLN4L, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH6iqFe-E4hIyYrSz6vj5ZadEZl4jd8tmzMluUGP7kJOdrGkJU6lsdeZVFXR18RToYndQOi0bifUeBP7VsG4UA3cbYji78ePHjWOoSRC5t2Jq8SAslzFe-StlhIBNo6VOltiJi789H3BKHlxZpLZTiwELvRDOMXe6rC-AyAiUlcZik-jRf8iKQ4yZ5NmQ66JjxM, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGO4AuXkhEmeBIMqn9ulhGxTz3EmRl2N9WtbYNzeRRDNy3oGQ36QBVWsSP0dKDEmQR3-5p-QZIHJIoT6NcNZXOWBpNErWR35JJRLsdyJ4V6Ms9F70fmsZ7FgI5an1riszLY', additional_properties={}), prompt=None, context=None, rollouts=None, meta=SampleMeta(additional_properties={'sample_id': '85ef317d-c041-4ced-bd7d-0284f7a365a2', 'filter_reason': 'Undetermined label', 'parent_sample_id': '1061e3ca-99f9-45b9-974a-d23567c19062', 'processing_time_ms': 16695.642}), is_valid=False, additional_properties={})]"
